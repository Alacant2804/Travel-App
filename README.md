## 🎓 What I Learned

While building Travel App, I gained valuable insights and improved my skills in the following areas:

* ***React:*** Understanding component structure, state and props.
* ***State Management:*** Using useState, useEffect, and useContext to manage dynamic data and side effects.
* ***Backend Development:*** Setting up and working with Node.js, Express.
* ***Database:*** Setting up MongoDB database and querying data.
* ***API Integration:*** Fetching and handling data from external APIs using Axios.
* ***CSS Styling:*** Applying responsive design principles for a better user experience.
* ***Debugging:*** Tackling issues with state management and component re-renders.
* ***Optimization & Performance:*** Improving app efficiency by reducing unnecessary re-renders, caching API responses, optimizing database queries, and implementing lazy loading.

## Improvements
